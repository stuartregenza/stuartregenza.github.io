<h2>How To Prepare For Home Games On The Blue</h2>
<p><b>By Stuart Tregenza</b></p>
<p>The first and most important way to prepare ones self for
    a Boise State home game is to get a ticket. To do this 
    students must visit broncosports.com then follow a link at
    the top of the page to ticketmaster.com. Here, students will
    plug in the PROMO code "STUDENT" and booom, theres a free 
    ticket to the BSU home game.
    <h5>Terms & Conditions: Only full-time BSU students are
        eligible for free studnet tickets, part-time students 
        get discounted tickets. While supplies last, ticket sales 
        are based off of a first come, first serve basis.
    </h5>
    <!--Terms and Conditions seemed like a cool thing to add,
    would definetly be in a professional article like this-->

</h3><b>Home Team Spirit</b></h3> 
<p>Many games throughout the season have themes like "White-Out"
    or "Black-Out" which are awesome but as long as fans wear 
    BSU gear or blue and orange they'll fit in with the crowd.
