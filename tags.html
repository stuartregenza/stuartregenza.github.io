    <h2>How To Prepare For Home Games On The Blue</h2>
    <p><b>By Stuart Tregenza</b></p>
    <p>The first and most important way to prepare ones self for
        a Boise State home game is to get a ticket. To do this 
        students must visit broncosports.com then follow a link at
        the top of the page to ticketmaster.com. Here, students will
        plug in the PROMO code "STUDENT" and booom, theres a free 
        ticket to the BSU home game.
        <h5>Terms & Conditions: Only full-time BSU students are
            eligible for free studnet tickets, part-time students 
            get discounted tickets. While supplies last, ticket sales 
            are based off of a first come, first serve basis.
        </h5>
        <!--Terms and Conditions seemed like a cool thing to add,
        would definetly be in a professional article like this-->

    </h3><b>Home Team Spirit</b></h3> 
    <p>Many games throughout the season have themes like "White-Out"
        or "Black-Out" which are awesome but as long as fans wear 
        BSU gear or blue and orange they'll fit in with the crowd.
