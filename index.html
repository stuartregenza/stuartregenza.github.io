    <h2>How To Prepare For Home Games On The Blue</h2>
    <p><b>By Stuart Tregenza</b></p>
    <p>The first and most important way to prepare ones self for
        a Boise State home game is to get a ticket. To do this 
        students must visit broncosports.com then follow a link at
        the top of the page to ticketmaster.com. Here, students will
        plug in the PROMO code "STUDENT" and booom, theres a free 
        ticket to the BSU home game.
        <h5>Terms & Conditions: Only full-time BSU students are
            eligible for free studnet tickets, part-time students 
            get discounted tickets. While supplies last, ticket sales 
            are based off of a first come, first serve basis.
        </h5>
        <!--Terms and Conditions seemed like a cool thing to add,
        would definetly be in a professional article like this-->

    </h3><b>Home Team Spirit</b></h3> 
    <p>Many games throughout the season have themes like "White-Out"
        or "Black-Out" which are awesome but as long as fans wear 
        BSU gear or blue and orange they'll fit in with the crowd.

<h4>What Do I Need To Do To Start Kayaking?</h4>
<p><b>By Beth Skwarecki</b></p>
<p>To clear your head and get some easy exercise, 
  the only thing that beats walking is getting out on the 
  water. I’m lucky to live close enough to a lake that I can 
  go for a sunset kayak a few days each week, where I watch 
  birds and sometimes just bring a snack, drop an anchor, 
  and float for a little bit.</p>
  <p>I finally bought my own kayak a few years back, and I 
    have absolutely zero regrets. It turned kayaking from a 
    thing I did when the weather was good and the rental place
    was open, to something I can just do anytime. Here’s what 
    ou need to know if you’d like to join me.</p>

<h2><b>Rent A Kayak Before You Buy One</b></h2>
<p>Before buying a kayak—which is a good option if you know 
  you’ll use it often—it’s smart to rent one a few times. 
  If you don’t have a way to store and transport it, renting 
  may be your only option anyway. (Although there are 
  inflatable and foldable models, but more about those another
  ime.)</p>

<h2>How Do You Paddle Anyway</h2>
<p>Your first time in a kayak, you will be focused on practical
   considerations like how the hell do I steer this thing. 
   It’s okay if you don’t think any further ahead than that. 
   (Here, by the way, is a video showing you how to steer this
   thing.)</p>

 <p>A proper paddle stroke uses your core and your lats (upper back)
    to pull the paddle toward you while you brace your body against the
     boat. You may also have sore deltoids (shoulders) your first time 
     from the work you’re doing in raising the free end of the paddle 
     out of the water. All told, a hard paddling session is somewhere 
     in between a cardio and a strength workout.</p>
